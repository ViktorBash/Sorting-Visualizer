# Sorting Visualizer
This is a sorting visualizer made with Javascript and some Bootstrap. It has **bubble sort, quick sort, insertion sort, selection sort and merge sort** . You can adjust the speed of the sorting with a slider.

Here is a GIF of the project, but don't forget to check it out yourself at https://viktorbash.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/
